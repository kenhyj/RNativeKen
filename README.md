## Hardware requirement
Mobile Phone
    Android anything after 2012
    IOS preferably 7+

If Mobile Phone is not readily available, 
you are free to use phone emulators, be aware that 
CPU and RAM usages are extremely high for these emulators. 

## system requirements


## Running Dev

``` bash
cd kenrnative00 
npm install
npm start
``` 

### presentability for big audience
https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy
This allows you to hook up the phone to your computer and screenshare.
You can then hook up the computer to a project via HDMI or RGB or DVI cable. 
Make sure the mobile device is in developer mode otherwise the scrcpy will not be able to screenshare.
